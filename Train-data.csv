She does not approve this type of language politics. Kordic describes the language of Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins as a pluricentric language, with four standard variants spoken in Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. These variants do differ slightly, as is the case with other pluricentric languages (e.g. English, German, French, Portuguese, Spanish), but not to a degree which would justify considering them as different languages. This fact suggests by no means a re-establishment of a common state, since standard variants of all other polycentric languages are spoken in different countries, e.g. English in the USA, UK, Australia, and Canada, German in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland."
